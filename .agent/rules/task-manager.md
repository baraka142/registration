# Master Instructions: Daily Task Manager

## 1. Design & Vibe
- **Theme:** Strictly Dark Mode (Deep Obsidian background).
- **Accents:** Neon Purple (#a855f7) and "Cyberpunk Green" (#22c55e).
- **Mobile First:** Everything must look clean on a phone screen.

## 2. Coding Laws
- **Persistence:** Use LocalStorage so tasks don't disappear on refresh.
- **Login:** Keep the Firebase authentication logic we already have.
- **Verification:** Use the Browser Agent to test "Add Task" after every change.

## 3. Goals
- Add a "Focus Timer" (Pomodoro) for study sessions.
- Make task check-offs feel smooth with CSS animations.ss
